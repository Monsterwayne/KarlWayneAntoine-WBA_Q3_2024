1. Scenario 1: Users Deposit Native SOL When Subscribing to a Creator's Vault
MVP:

Pros: Simple and straightforward to implement. Involves basic staking logic and allows direct interaction with Solanaâ€™s native staking functionalities. Easier to manage and test in early stages.
Cons: Requires more active management of staked SOL and might incur higher costs due to frequent unstaking and staking operations.
Founder Perspective:

Pros: Lower development complexity and quicker to market. Offers a clear value proposition by directly passing staking rewards to creators.
Cons: May have limitations in scalability and might not leverage the full capabilities of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) on Solana.
User Experience:

Pros: Transparent and easy to understand for users. Users are familiar with SOL and may prefer direct SOL staking.
Cons: Unstaking delays could frustrate users who want instant withdrawals.
PMF:

Pros: Clear product offering with a straightforward reward mechanism. Easier to communicate value to early adopters.
Cons: Less flexibility and innovation compared to using LSTs or staking pools, which may limit appeal to more advanced users.
2. Scenario 2: Users Deposit a Specific Liquid Staking Token (LST) When Subscribing to a Creator's Vault
MVP:

Pros: Requires less active management as LSTs automatically generate yield. Easier to build compared to a full staking pool mechanism.
Cons: Depends on users understanding and trusting LSTs, which might not be familiar to all.
Founder Perspective:

Pros: Medium complexity, allows for a unique product offering with passive yield generation. Can leverage existing LST infrastructure.
Cons: Relies on the performance and liquidity of third-party LST protocols, introducing external dependencies.
User Experience:

Pros: Simplifies yield generation as users do not need to worry about staking directly. Allows easy withdrawal of LST.
Cons: Requires users to understand LST concepts, which might be challenging for some.
PMF:

Pros: Can differentiate the product in a crowded market by using innovative DeFi mechanisms. Could appeal to crypto-savvy users interested in yield farming.
Cons: Limited to users who are familiar with LSTs, which might restrict initial market size.
3. Scenario 3: Users Deposit SOL, Which Is Pooled into a Staking Pool Managed by the Platform
MVP:

Pros: Can offer high rewards through efficient staking pool management. Provides a unique mechanism of issuing LST tickets, allowing users flexibility in using tokens elsewhere.
Cons: Highest development complexity due to managing a staking pool and ensuring accurate LST issuance and redemption.
Founder Perspective:

Pros: High potential for differentiation and growth. Aligns with advanced DeFi concepts, potentially capturing a niche market of power users.
Cons: Significant initial investment in development and security to manage pooled funds and issue LSTs. Higher risk due to complexity.
User Experience:

Pros: Allows users to benefit from staking without direct involvement. The flexibility of using LST tickets in other protocols enhances appeal.
Cons: Complex user journey with more steps (minting, redeeming tickets). Risk of losing SOL if LST tickets are not managed properly, which could deter risk-averse users.
PMF:

Pros: High potential to attract advanced users and yield-focused investors. Could become a go-to platform for staking and DeFi interactions.
Cons: Niche appeal, potentially high barriers to entry for mainstream users who are not familiar with DeFi mechanisms.
Recommendation:
Based on the analysis, Scenario 2 seems to be the best fit for an MVP:

Simplicity and Ease of Implementation: Compared to Scenario 3, it is easier to implement and requires less active management than Scenario 1.
Appeal to Users: Offers a unique value proposition with passive yield generation without needing active staking management, which is appealing to both new and experienced users.
Founder Perspective: Provides a balance between innovation and complexity, allowing the platform to differentiate itself while leveraging existing DeFi infrastructure.
Potential for Product-Market Fit: Can attract a broad user base, especially crypto-savvy individuals interested in yield farming and DeFi opportunities, while still being accessible to new users willing to learn about LSTs.
Scenario 1 is a close second, especially if you want to prioritize simplicity and direct interaction with native SOL staking.

Scenario 3 could be a future enhancement after establishing a user base, as it offers advanced functionalities and potentially higher rewards but at the cost of greater complexity and risk.
