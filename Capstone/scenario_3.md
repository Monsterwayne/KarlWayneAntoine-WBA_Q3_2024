------Scenario 3
Stake Pool

User Deposits SOL When Subscribing

When a user subscribes to a creator on your platform, they deposit SOL into the creator's vault, which is integrated with a staking pool. Here’s the technical breakdown:

Creator's Vault as Staking Pool: The creator's vault is a Program Derived Address (PDA) that acts as an entry point for SOL deposits and is linked to a staking pool managed by your platform.

Deposit Process:

User Transaction: The user initiates a transaction to deposit SOL into the creator's vault (PDA).
Smart Contract Interaction: The platform smart contract processes the deposit and mints a corresponding LST token for the user, which acts as a receipt or ticket representing their share in the staking pool.
LST Token Minting: Upon deposit, an LST (Liquid Staking Token) is minted and transferred to the user’s wallet. This LST represents their staked SOL in the staking pool.

Staking Pool Structure: The staking pool is a centralized smart contract (PDA) that aggregates SOL deposits from all users subscribing to various creators.

Deposit Process:

User Deposit: The user deposits SOL into the staking pool, which is associated with the creator's vault they wish to subscribe to.
Smart Contract Interaction: The platform smart contract manages these deposits, updating the staking pool’s state with each new contribution.
SOL Delegation: The staking pool smart contract then delegates the aggregated SOL to a validator or a set of validators based on predefined rules or selections made by the platform or the creators.

---- Handling SOL and Minting LST Tokens

When SOL is deposited into the staking pool, an LST token (representing the staked SOL) is minted and transferred to the user’s wallet as a “ticket.” This ticket represents their share in the staking pool.

Minting LST Tokens:

Token Minting: Upon depositing SOL, the staking pool mints an equivalent amount of LST tokens proportional to the user's deposited amount and current LST value.
LST as a Ticket: These LST tokens act as a “ticket” for the user, signifying their share in the staking pool and allowing them to participate in yield generation.
Transfer to User Wallet: The minted LST tokens are automatically transferred to the user’s wallet. Users can hold onto these tokens or use them in other DeFi protocols, but their claim to the SOL and its yield is tied to these tokens.


******Technical Considerations:

PDA Authority: The PDA must have the authority to manage staking operations, including minting LST tokens and delegating SOL to validators.
Staking Pool Logic: Your smart contract must include logic to handle multiple deposits, manage validator delegations, and track LST tokens issued.
Liquidity and Solvency: Ensure that the staking pool maintains enough liquidity to handle potential user withdrawals without impacting the overall staking operation.

Minting Process: The staking pool smart contract must have a mechanism for minting LST tokens whenever SOL is deposited.
Tokenomics: The value of LST tokens should reflect the total staked SOL and any accrued yield, meaning the token's value should increase as staking rewards are earned.
