Why I'm doing this ?

- Not many crypto application make sense for me in terms on onboarding non crypto native people and not financial native people also
- Trying to onboard the next 1000 great people, instead of on oborading millions
- Shill to my friends and family an app they can use
- Support the people I want to support in the space without needing to necessarely contact them. Just deposit SOL
- Experiment and see if I can create a patreon model onchain using the Staking SOL/Validator Economy





/////////////////////////////////////////////////
1. Transparency and Trust
Traditional Patreon Model:

Challenges: Centralized platforms like Patreon operate as intermediaries, which can lead to issues with transparency regarding fees, payments, and policies. Creators often have limited visibility into the exact mechanisms behind their earnings and the platform's fee structure.
Your Solana-based Model:

Benefits: Blockchain technology inherently provides transparency through public ledgers. Transactions, deposits, and withdrawals are recorded on the blockchain, offering a transparent view of where funds go and how they are managed. This transparency can build trust between creators and subscribers, as both parties can verify all transactions independently.
2. Control Over Funds
Traditional Patreon Model:

Challenges: Creators rely on Patreon to handle all funds, which includes processing payments, managing subscriptions, and distributing payouts. Patreon takes a percentage fee, and creators have to trust that the platform will manage their funds appropriately and fairly.
Your Solana-based Model:

Benefits: By using decentralized finance (DeFi) principles, your model gives creators direct control over their funds. Creators can receive staking rewards directly to their wallets, bypassing intermediaries. The use of Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) ensures funds are securely managed on-chain without relying on a centralized entity.
3. Enhanced Earnings Through Yield Generation
Traditional Patreon Model:

Challenges: In traditional models, creators receive a fixed percentage of the subscription fee, with the platform taking a cut. The funds simply sit in accounts without earning any additional value.
Your Solana-based Model:

Benefits: Your model introduces an innovative way for creators to earn additional income through staking and yield generation. When subscribers deposit SOL, it’s swapped into Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), which continue to earn staking rewards. This model allows creators to benefit from both the subscription fees and the yield generated by staking, potentially increasing their earnings significantly.
4. Flexibility for Users and Creators
Traditional Patreon Model:

Challenges: Traditional models are often rigid. Subscribers pay a fixed fee, and creators have limited ways to incentivize or reward their audience beyond content creation.
Your Solana-based Model:

Benefits: The flexibility of your model allows creators to choose different LSTs, set their own yield strategies, and potentially offer more tailored incentives to subscribers. This flexibility can create a more dynamic and engaging platform, encouraging creativity and competition among creators to offer the best value.
5. Reduced Fees and Intermediaries
Traditional Patreon Model:

Challenges: Patreon and similar platforms charge fees for their services, which can significantly reduce a creator's take-home earnings. Payment processors (like credit card companies) also take a cut.
Your Solana-based Model:

Benefits: A blockchain-based solution can reduce or eliminate many of these fees. While there are still transaction fees on Solana, they are generally lower than traditional payment processing fees. The model also removes intermediaries, meaning more of the subscription value can go directly to the creator.
6. Global Accessibility and Censorship Resistance
Traditional Patreon Model:

Challenges: Platforms like Patreon are subject to local regulations and censorship. They can block payments or accounts based on external pressures, and creators in certain regions might face difficulties accessing the platform.
Your Solana-based Model:

Benefits: Blockchain technology offers a level of censorship resistance and global accessibility. As long as a user has internet access and a Solana wallet, they can interact with your platform. This opens up possibilities for creators in regions that might otherwise be restricted.
Areas Where Challenges Remain
While your Solana-based model addresses several pain points of traditional subscription platforms, it also introduces new challenges:

User Education and Onboarding: Users must understand blockchain concepts, wallets, and tokens, which could deter those unfamiliar with crypto.
Volatility and Risk: The value of SOL and LSTs can fluctuate, potentially affecting both creators' earnings and users' experiences. Users who are unfamiliar with crypto risks might find this volatility challenging.
Regulatory Uncertainty: Blockchain and DeFi are still emerging areas with evolving regulations. The platform could face legal challenges depending on jurisdictional rules about financial transactions, securities, and digital assets.
Usability and Complexity: Blockchain interfaces and processes can be more complex than traditional web applications, requiring a user experience that balances security with ease of use.
Conclusion
Your model offers significant improvements over traditional subscription platforms by enhancing transparency, control, and potential earnings for creators while reducing fees and adding flexibility. However, it also introduces new complexities related to user education, market volatility, and regulatory compliance.

If you can address these challenges—perhaps by providing educational resources, building a user-friendly interface, and closely monitoring regulatory developments—your Solana-based subscription platform could offer a compelling alternative to traditional models like Patreon, particularly for crypto-savvy users and creators looking to maximize their earnings through innovative DeFi mechanisms.
