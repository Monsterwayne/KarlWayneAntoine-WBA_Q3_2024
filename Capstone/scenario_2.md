Context :

-Create a Vault (PDA): Each creator has a Program Derived Address (PDA) that acts as their vault to hold the deposited SOL.

-Deposit Process: 

User Transaction: The user initiates a transaction to deposit their LST into the creator's vault (PDA).
Smart Contract Interaction: The platform smart contract processes the deposit and updates the vault's state to reflect the new balance.
Recording User Details: The user’s subscription details, such as the amount deposited, the type of LST, and the timestamp, are recorded in the platform’s ledger or state management system.

Scenario 2

Handling LSTs in the Creator's Vault:
Once LSTs are deposited in the creator's vault, the platform needs to manage these tokens to maximize yield. Here’s the technical approach:


-----Yield Generation:

LST Characteristics: LSTs are yield-bearing tokens. This means the amount of LST remains constant in the creator's vault, but their value in the underlying asset (like SOL) increases over time.
Yield Accumulation: The yield is automatically accrued in the LST itself. No additional staking operations are needed because the LST is already generating rewards.


*****Technical Considerations:

Vault Structure: The vault (PDA) needs to be capable of holding and tracking LSTs, which may require integrating with specific Solana programs that support LST management.
Platform Logic: The smart contract logic must account for LST balances and yield calculations, ensuring accurate yield distribution to the creator.


Distributing 100% of the LST Yield Rewards to the Creator

To ensure that 100% of the LST yield rewards from multiple users are given to the creator, follow this process:

-----Yield Collection and Distribution:

Monitoring Yield Growth: The platform smart contract regularly checks the yield accrued in the LSTs held in the vault. This can be done by checking the LST value against the underlying asset (SOL) using price oracles or programmatic checks.

Converting Yield to Rewards: The yield can either be left in the vault as additional LSTs or converted back to SOL (or another token) to transfer to the creator’s treasury or another PDA.

Converting LST to SOL: Use a swap mechanism, like the Jupiter protocol, to convert the yield portion of the LST back to SOL. The smart contract needs to calculate the exact amount to swap without affecting the principal.

Transferring Yield to Creator: Once the yield is converted or identified, it is transferred to the creator’s wallet or another designated PDA.


******Technical Considerations:

Yield Conversion Costs: Converting LST yield to SOL may incur fees, and these should be accounted for in the platform's financial model.
Accurate Yield Calculation: Regular and accurate checking of LST yield growth is crucial. Use reliable data sources and programmatic checks to ensure correct yield distribution.
Automation: Implement an automated process (e.g., cron jobs or scheduled transactions) to periodically check and distribute the yield to the creator.

--------User Withdrawals (Unsubscribing)


Users should be able to withdraw their LST, effectively unsubscribing from the creator. Here's how the withdrawal process would work:

Withdrawal Process:

Withdrawal Request: The user initiates a withdrawal request, specifying the amount of LST they wish to withdraw from the creator's vault.
Yield Calculation on Withdrawal: The platform must calculate the yield generated by the user’s LST since deposit, which remains with the creator. Only the original amount of LST is returned to the user.
LST Transfer: The specified LST amount is transferred from the creator's vault (PDA) back to the user's wallet.

*******Technical Considerations:

Maintaining Yield with Creator: When users withdraw, ensure that only the principal LST amount is returned, while any accrued yield remains with the creator.
Tracking User Deposits: Maintain accurate records of each user’s deposited amount, including timestamps, to calculate yield accurately during withdrawal.
Withdrawal Fees: There might be fees associated with the withdrawal transaction, which should be transparently communicated to users.
